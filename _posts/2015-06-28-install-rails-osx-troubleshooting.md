This are resources that helped me to install rails@4.2 for the first
time in my OSX that might be helpful for beginners.

- [Install Ruby on Rails Â· Mac OS X Yosemite](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html)
- [Installing Norogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html)

Cheers!
